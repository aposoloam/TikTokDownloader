# TikTokDownloader
An open-source CLI utility written in Java to download your TikTok posts using requested data text files now that it's banned in the United States.

## Step 1.
[Request your data from TikTok](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/personalized-ads-and-data/requesting-your-data) in .txt format.
As of 11:39 MDT on 1/18/2025, the page is down due to excessive requests.

## Step 2.
Copy the "Post.txt" file from "C:\Downloads\TikTok_Data_xxxxx\Tiktok\Posts\Post.txt" (or wherever else you downloaded it to) into the project directory.

## Step 3.
Run the program.

It will take some time to download all of your videos, but you should see them fill the "Vids" project folder.
