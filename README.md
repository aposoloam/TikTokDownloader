## TikTokDownloader
An open-source utility written in Java to download your TikTok posts using requested data text files now that it's banned in the United States.

# Step 1.
[Request your data from TikTok](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/personalized-ads-and-data/requesting-your-data) in .txt format.
As of 11:39 MDT on 1/18/2025, the page is down due to excessive requests.

# Step 2.
Navigate to the project folder and replace the blank "Post.txt" file in the project folder with the requested file found at "C:\Downloads\TikTok_Data_xxxxx\Tiktok\Posts\Post.txt" or wherever else you downloaded the data to.

# Step 3.
Run the program.

It will take some time to download all of your videos, but you should see them fill in to the "Videos" project folder.
